# Eco Watch

Eco Watch is an innovative project aimed at leveraging machine learning to enhance safety and cleanliness in public spaces. This project utilizes CCTV footage to detect fires, unauthorized trash disposal, and report accidents to the authorities.

## Features

- **Fire Detection**: Eco Watch employs a machine learning model to detect fires in real-time from CCTV footage. When a fire is detected, it triggers an alert to notify local authorities for timely intervention.

- **Trash Detection**: The system also identifies instances of people throwing trash in non-designated areas through image analysis. By detecting and reporting such incidents, Eco Watch promotes cleanliness and responsible waste management practices.

- **Accident Reporting**: Eco Watch allows users to upload photos of accidents, such as car crashes or pedestrian incidents. These reports are sent to relevant authorities, including the police and local government agencies, for appropriate action.

## Usage

1. **Fire Detection**: The machine learning model for fire detection can be run on CCTV footage by providing the video feed as input. The model will analyze the footage and generate alerts when it detects a fire.

2. **Trash Detection**: Similarly, the trash detection feature operates by analyzing video feeds from CCTV cameras. It identifies instances of unauthorized trash disposal and sends alerts to the appropriate authorities.

3. **Accident Reporting**: Users can upload photos of accidents via the Eco Watch web or mobile application. The system processes these images and forwards the reports to the relevant emergency services and local authorities.

## Installation

To run Eco Watch locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
