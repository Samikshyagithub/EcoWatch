Eco Watch is an innovative project aimed at leveraging machine learning to enhance safety and cleanliness in public spaces. This project utilizes CCTV footage to detect fires, unauthorized trash disposal, and report accidents to the authorities.

## Design and Functionality

1. **Fire Detection**: At the heart of Eco Watch lies a sophisticated machine learning framework meticulously trained to discern the subtlest flicker of flames amidst different landscapes urban and vegetation. This Yolov8 model, finely tuned through vast datasets, swiftly identifies incipient fires in real-time CCTV footage. Its robust architecture ensures minimal false alarms, prioritizing accuracy and prompt intervention. Moreover, the sleek interface provides seamless integration with existing surveillance systems, augmenting their capabilities without imposing undue burdens on infrastructure.

2. **Trash Detection**: With an acute eye for environmental stewardship, Eco Watch extends its vigilance to combat the blight of unauthorized trash disposal. Leveraging cutting-edge video analysis algorithms based on Yolov8, it scrutinizes every pixel of surveillance feeds, swiftly pinpointing instances of littering and illicit dumping. Through dynamic alerts, authorities are promptly notified, fostering a culture of accountability and nurturing pristine public spaces. The intuitive dashboard empowers administrators with comprehensive analytics, illuminating trends and hotspots for targeted intervention.

3. **Accident Reporting**: In the event of vehicular mishaps or pedestrian emergencies, Eco Watch emerges as a guardian angel, facilitating swift and effective response. Through its user-friendly interface, individuals seamlessly transmit photographic evidence of incidents, triggering a cascade of coordinated action. The system harnesses the power of geospatial data, dispatching precise coordinates to emergency services and law enforcement agencies.
